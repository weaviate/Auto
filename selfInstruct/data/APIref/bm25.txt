Basic BM25 search

To use BM25 search, you must provide a search string as a minimum.

The below example uses default settings, looking for objects containing the keyword `food` anywhere in the object.

It ranks the results using BM25F, and returns the top 3.

```graphql
{
  Get {
    JeopardyQuestion(
      limit: 3,
      bm25: {
        query: "food"
      }
    ) {
      question
      answer
    }
  }
}
```
