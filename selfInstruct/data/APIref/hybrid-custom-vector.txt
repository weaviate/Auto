Custom Vector for Hybrid Search

You can provide your own `vector` input to the hybrid query. In this scenario, Weaviate will use the query string for the `bm25` search and the input vector for the vector search.

The below example supplies the vector for "italian food", while using "food" as the query text. Note how the results have now skewed towards Italian food.

```graphql
{
  Get {
    JeopardyQuestion(
      limit: 3,
      hybrid: {
        query: "food",
        vector: [0.013085687533020973, -0.00777443777769804, 0.005439540836960077, ...]
      }
    ) {
      question
      answer
    }
  }
}
```
