Group results by a property or cross-reference

You can group search results by any arbitrary property or cross-reference.

The example below searches the `JeopardyQuestion` class for objects best matching `"animals in movies"`, fetching the 10 closest results. Then those results are grouped by `round`, returning a maximum of two groups, each group with a maximum of two results (`hits`):

```graphql
{
  Get {
    JeopardyQuestion(
      nearText: {
        concepts: ["animals in movies"],
      }
      limit: 10
      groupBy: {
        path: ["round"],
        groups: 2,
        objectsPerGroup: 2
      }
    ) {
      _additional {
        group {
          id
          groupedBy {
            path
            value
          }
          count
          minDistance
          maxDistance
          hits {
            question
            answer
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
