Where filter + BM25

Add a conditional (`where`) filter[]

You can add a conditional filter to any BM25 search query, which will filter the outputs but not impact the ranking.

The below example searches for objects containing the keyword `food` in any field and which have the `round` property of `Double Jeopardy!`, ranks them using BM25F, and returns the top 3.

```graphql
{
  Get {
    JeopardyQuestion(
      limit: 3
      bm25: {
        query: "food"
      }
      where: {
        path: ["round"]
        operator: Equal
        valueText: "Double Jeopardy!"
      }
    ) {
      question
      answer
      _additional {
        score
      }
    }
  }
}
```
