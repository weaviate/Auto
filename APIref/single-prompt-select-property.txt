Single prompt property selection

When using generative search with single prompts, you must specify which object properties to use in the prompt.

The properties to use as a part of the prompt do not need to be among the properties retrieved in the query.

In the below example, the query:

Retrieves two JeopardyQuestion objects related to World history,
Prepares a prompt for each object, based on the prompt "Convert this quiz question: {question} and answer: {answer} into a trivia tweet. where {question} and {answer} are object properties, and
Retrieves a generated text for each object (2 total), and
Returns the generated text as a part of each object.
Note that the question and answer properties are not retrieved in the query, but are used in the prompt.

```graphql
{
  Get {
    JeopardyQuestion (
      nearText: {
        concepts: ["World history"]
      }
      limit: 2
    ) {
      _additional {
        generate(
          singleResult: {
            prompt: """
              Convert this quiz question: {question} and answer: {answer} into a trivia tweet.
            """
          }
        ) {
          singleResult
          error
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
